usb-relay - USB relay control module
====================================

usb-relay is a quick 'n dirty relay controller based on two very cheap
off-the-shelf boards.

Quickstart
----------

- Install gcc-arm-embedded compiler toolchain (or similar arm-none-eabi-
  compiler).
- +make+
- +make -C src/bootloader flash+
- +make -C src/i2c-cm3-usb flash+

To flash the bootloader an STLink v2 must be connected to the target
boards JTAG/SWD socket.

To flash the main firmware the microcontroller must be connected to the
host using its own USB socket.

Hardware setup
--------------

The firmware can be easily ported but has been tested on an small 
STM32F103C8T6 based breakout board. Connections required are:

- USB to host computer
- TODO: I2C pins
